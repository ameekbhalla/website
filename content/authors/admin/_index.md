I have been researching the inheritance of complex disorders like diabetes, heart disease, and Alzheimer's disease for 14 years.
My expertise lies in designing experiments that produce decisive results, selecting machine learning tools that balance rigor with feasibility, creating data visualizations that can be understood at the first glance, and composing clear reports that avoid jargon.
The top personality traits that my colleagues seek me out for are my critical-thinking skills, emotional stability, and openness to ideas.
I am interested in developing predictive applications for personalized medicine, biotechnology, and pharmaceuticals.
Please get in touch if you want to hear how genomic data might help in making predictions in your field too.
