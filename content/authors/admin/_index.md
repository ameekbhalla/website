<h3>

Hello, I am a data scientist and geneticist ---</h3>

I am interested in using genomics for making predictions in medicine, biotechnology, and pharmaceuticals.
My expertise lies in designing decisive quantitative experiments, selecting practical machine learning tools, creating intuitive data visualizations, and composing jargon-free reports.
<!--# The top personality traits that my colleagues seek me out for are my critical-thinking skills, emotional stability, and openness to ideas. ---> Please get in touch if you belong to the life science industry and would like to hear more about genomics.
